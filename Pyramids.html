          The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the
          Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in
          the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo,
          Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and
          the only one to remain largely intact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a
          reference to the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists
          believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10- to 20-year
          period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially standing at 146.5 metres
          (481 feet),
        </p>
        <p>
          the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for
          more than 3,800 years until Lincoln Cathedral was finished in 1311 AD.
          It is estimated that the pyramid weighs approximately 6 million
          tonnes, and consists of 2.3 million blocks of limestone and granite,
          some weighing as much as 80 tonnes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by limestone casing stones
          that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the
          underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered
          the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been
          varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's
          construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are
          based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a
          quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.

        Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth
        Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as "Cheops") and was
        constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called
        Hemon), is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It
        is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 146.6
        metres (481.0 ft) tall, but with the removal of its original casing, its
        present height is 137 metres (449.5 ft). The lengths of the sides at the
        base are difficult to reconstruct, given the absence of the casing, but
        recent analyses put them in a range between 230.26 metres (755.4 ft) and
        230.44 metres (756.0 ft). The volume, including an internal hillock, is
        roughly 2,300,000 cubic metres (81,000,000 cu ft).
      </p>

      <p>
        The first precision measurements of the pyramid were made by
        Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie in 1880–82 and published as The
        Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh. Almost all reports are based on his
        measurements. Many of the casing-stones and inner chamber blocks of the
        Great Pyramid fit together with extremely high precision. Based on
        measurements taken on the north-eastern casing stones, the mean opening
        of the joints is only 0.5 millimetres (0.020 in) wide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pyramid remained the tallest man-made structure in the world for
        over 3,800 years,unsurpassed until the 160-metre-tall (520 ft) spire of
        Lincoln Cathedral was completed c. 1300. The accuracy of the pyramid's
        workmanship is such that the four sides of the base have an average
        error of only 58 millimetres in length. The base is horizontal and flat
        to within ±15 mm (0.6 in).[9] The sides of the square base are closely
        aligned to the four cardinal compass points (within four minutes of arc)
        based on true north, not magnetic north, and the finished base was
        squared to a mean corner error of only 12 seconds of arc.

        The Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks which most
        believe to have been transported from nearby quarries. The Tura
        limestone used for the casing was quarried across the river. The largest
        granite stones in the pyramid, found in the "King's" chamber, weigh 25
        to 80 tonnes and were transported from Aswan, more than 800 km (500 mi)
        away.[citation needed] Ancient Egyptians cut stone into rough blocks by
        hammering grooves into natural stone faces, inserting wooden wedges,
        then soaking these with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges
        expanded, breaking off workable chunks. Once the blocks were cut, they
        were carried by boat either up or down the Nile River to the pyramid. It
        is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of
        granite (imported from Aswan), and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in
        the construction of the Great Pyramid

        The original entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north, 17 metres
        (56 ft) vertically above ground level and 7.29 metres (23.9 ft) east of
        the center line of the pyramid. From this original entrance, there is a
        Descending Passage 0.96 metres (3.1 ft) high and 1.04 metres (3.4 ft)
        wide, which goes down at an angle of 26° 31'23" through the masonry of
        the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it. After 105.23 metres
        (345.2 ft), the passage becomes level and continues for an additional
        8.84 metres (29.0 ft) to the lower Chamber, which appears not to have
        been finished. There is a continuation of the horizontal passage in the
        south wall of the lower chamber; there is also a pit dug in the floor of
        the chamber. Some Egyptologists suggest that this Lower Chamber was
        intended to be the original burial chamber, but Pharaoh Khufu later
        changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.

        28.2 metres (93 ft) from the entrance is a square hole in the roof of
        the Descending Passage. Originally concealed with a slab of stone, this
        is the beginning of the Ascending Passage. The Ascending Passage is 39.3
        metres (129 ft) long, as wide and high as the Descending Passage and
        slopes up at almost precisely the same angle to reach the Grand Gallery.
        The lower end of the Ascending Passage is closed by three huge blocks of
        granite, each about 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) long. One must use the Robbers'
        Tunnel At the start of the Grand Gallery on the right-hand side there is
        a hole cut in the wall. This is the start of a vertical shaft which
        follows an irregular path through the masonry of the pyramid to join the
        Descending Passage. Also at the start of the Grand Gallery there is the
        Horizontal Passage leading to the "Queen's Chamber". The passage is 1.1m
        (3'8") high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step
        in the floor, after which the passage is 1.73 metres (5.7 ft) high.
